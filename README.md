Chess Game README
Overview
This project is a simple Chess game implemented in Java. It uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern:

Model: The ChessBoard class (and supporting piece classes) containing game logic and data structures.
View: The ChessBoardFrame (graphical interface) and ChessView (placeholder class for a possible text-based or alternative view).
Controller: The ChessController class that processes user actions and updates the model and view.
Folder / Class Structure
model.board

Board.java: Interface defining essential board operations (retrieving/moving pieces, tracking scores, etc.).
ChessBoard.java: Concrete implementation of Board. Manages an 8×8 array of ChessPiece objects, piece initialization (startGame), move validation, check/checkmate detection, etc.
model.piece

ChessPiece
Pawn.java, Rook.java, Knight.java, Bishop.java, Queen.java, King.java: Classes representing the various chess pieces, each implementing the ChessPiece interface.
Each piece has:
A position (row, col)
An isWhite flag for color
A getValidMoves(...) method that returns a list of valid target squares.
A clone() method for creating copies of pieces if needed.
view

ChessBoardFrame.java: The primary Swing-based GUI for the chessboard. It draws an 8×8 grid of panels, each representing a square.
ChessView.java: A placeholder or alternative view class that could be used for textual or custom rendering of the board, graveyards, etc.
controller

ChessController.java: Coordinates interaction between the model (ChessBoard) and the view (ChessBoardFrame). Captures user clicks on squares, validates and executes moves, and triggers updates in the GUI.
Getting Started
Requirements

Java 8 or later (and Swing, which is included in standard JRE/JDK distributions).
Compilation

Navigate to the project root in a terminal.
Compile all .java files, for example:
bash
Copy
Edit
javac model/board/*.java model/piece/*.java view/*.java controller/*.java
Running the Program

There is no standalone main method in the provided files. You could introduce a Main.java in the project root like so:
java
Copy
Edit
public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
model.board.ChessBoard model = new model.board.ChessBoard();
view.ChessBoardFrame frame = new view.ChessBoardFrame(model, null);
controller.ChessController controller = new controller.ChessController(model, frame);
frame.setVisible(true);
controller.playGame();
}
}
Compile and run:
bash
Copy
Edit
javac Main.java
java Main
This will open the ChessBoardFrame GUI and initialize the game.
Usage

Once the program is running, the chessboard is displayed in a GUI window.
Click on a piece you want to move. The controller will highlight valid moves (in the sample code, you would need to fill in the highlightMoves(...) method).
Click on a target square to move there.
Moves are validated; you cannot move an opponent’s piece or make illegal chess moves.
The code includes partial logic for check, checkmate detection, castling, en passant stubs, etc.
Code Highlights
MVC Pattern: Clean separation of concerns. ChessController is the main point of contact between the model (ChessBoard) and the UI (ChessBoardFrame).
Polymorphism for Pieces: Each chess piece type (Pawn, Rook, etc.) implements common methods via the ChessPiece interface, but also defines its own movement logic in getValidMoves(...).
Game State: ChessBoard tracks active pieces on an 8×8 array, plus “graveyard” lists for captured pieces. The startGame() method positions all pieces in their starting locations.
Validation:
Checking boundaries with helper methods (isInBounds(...)).
Checking valid moves in each piece’s logic.
Checking if a color is in check or checkmate (isCheck(...), isCheckMate(...)).
Possible Extensions
AI or Bot: Implement an AI-based controller or engine that takes over one side or offers hints.
Enhanced UI:
Implement a system to visually highlight valid moves in ChessBoardFrame.
Add icons, special effects for captures, etc.
Additional Rules:
Complete or refine en passant detection and promotion logic (partially started in Pawn and ChessBoard).
Add timers, game clocks, or advanced rules like 50-move draws or threefold repetition.

This is still a work in progress, so I hope you enjoy watching this project come to fruition.
This is a passion project for me, and I will be working on it inconsistently.
Enjoy playing or modifying this Chess program! Feel free to customize or expand on it for your own educational or entertainment purposes.
